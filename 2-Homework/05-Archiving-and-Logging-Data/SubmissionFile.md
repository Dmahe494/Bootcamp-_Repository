### Step 1: Create, Extract, Compress, and Manage tar Backup Archives

1. Command to **extract** the `TarDocs.tar` archive to the current directory:
sudo tar -xf TarDocs.tar

2. Command to **create** the `Javaless_Doc.tar` archive from the `TarDocs/` directory, while excluding the `TarDocs/Documents/Java` directory:
sudo tar -cvf Javaless_Docs.tar Google-Maps-Hacks Design-Patterns IntelliJIDEA_ReferenceCard.pdf Music-Sheets

3. Command to ensure `Java/` is not in the new `Javaless_Docs.tar` archive:
sudo tar -tf Javaless_Docs.tar | grep -i 'java'

**Bonus** 
- Command to create an incremental archive called `logs_backup_tar.gz` with only changed files to `snapshot.file` for the `/var/log` directory:

#### Critical Analysis Question

- Why wouldn't you use the options `-x` and `-c` at the same time with `tar`?
 -c creates a new archive, -x extracts files from an existing archive.

### Step 2: Create, Manage, and Automate Cron Jobs

1. Cron job for backing up the `/var/log/auth.log` file:
00 6 * * 3 gzip ~/auth_backup.tgz /var/log/auth.log

### Step 3: Write Basic Bash Scripts

1. Brace expansion command to create the four subdirectories:
sudo mkdir -p ~/backups/{freemem,diskuse,openlist,freedisk}

2. Paste your `system.sh` script edits below:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
 2 sudo chmod -R 777 ~/backups
 3 #Prints the amount of free memory on the system and saves it to ~/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt.
sudo free -h > ~/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt
 4 #Prints disk usage and saves it to ~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt.
sudo du -h > ~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt
 5 #Lists all open files and saves it to ~/backups/openlist/open_list.txt.
sudo lsof > ~/backups/openlist/open_list.txt
 6 #Prints file system disk space statistics and saves it to ~/backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt.
sudo df -h > ~/backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt]
    ```

3. Command to make the `system.sh` script executable:
chmod +x system.sh

**Optional**
- Commands to test the script and confirm its execution:
sudo ./system.sh
cat free_mem.txt
cat disk_usage.txt
cat open_list.txt
cat free_disk.txt

**Bonus**
- Command to copy `system` to system-wide cron directory:

### Step 4. Manage Log File Sizes
 
1. Run `sudo nano /etc/logrotate.conf` to edit the `logrotate` configuration file. 

    Configure a log rotation scheme that backs up authentication messages to the `/var/log/auth.log`.

    - Add your config file edits below:

/var/log/auth.log {
# Rotates weekly
weekly
# Rotates only the seven most recent logs
rotate 7
# Does not rotate empty logs
notifempty
# Delays compression
delaycompress
# Skips error messages for missing logs and continues to next log
missingok
}

### Bonus: Check for Policy and File Violations

1. Command to verify `auditd` is active:
systemctl status auditd

2. Command to set number of retained logs and maximum log file size:

    - Add the edits made to the configuration file below:

    ```bash
    [Your solution edits here]
    ```

3. Command using `auditd` to set rules for `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/passwd` and `/var/log/auth.log`:


    - Add the edits made to the `rules` file below:

    ```bash
    [Your solution edits here]
    ```

4. Command to restart `auditd`:
systemctl resart auditd

5. Command to list all `auditd` rules:
auditctl -l

6. Command to produce an audit report:

7. Create a user with `sudo useradd attacker` and produce an audit report that lists account modifications:

8. Command to use `auditd` to watch `/var/log/cron`:

9. Command to verify `auditd` rules:

### Bonus (Research Activity): Perform Various Log Filtering Techniques

1. Command to return `journalctl` messages with priorities from emergency to error:

1. Command to check the disk usage of the system journal unit since the most recent boot:

1. Comand to remove all archived journal files except the most recent two:


1. Command to filter all log messages with priority levels between zero and two, and save output to `/home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt`:

1. Command to automate the last command in a daily cronjob. Add the edits made to the crontab file below:

    ```bash
    [Your solution cron edits here]
    ```
